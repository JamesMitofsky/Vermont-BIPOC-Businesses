# Documentation of Learning

## Installing Components Module
By default, Vue will let you import and export named components, but this process can become rather tedious at scale. The [Nuxt Components Module](https://github.com/nuxt/components) lets you sidestep the manual labor, instead just grabbing components inline as per usual. For example:
```
<Component />
```

## Fetching Content
* _Unclear:_ Fetching content from a component didn't work but fetching from a page did. Maybe that's because we build things on the page level, not the component level.
